ROS code for Tenacity - A SAWPPY-inspired rover
Containing a mix of code from myself, Rhys Mainwaring's "curio" Gazebo codebase and mw46d (Marco Walther). 

N.B. This is not really meant to be a complete project, but mostly my backup dump of the rover-related ROS catkin space on the rover. 
If you like it enough to fork or use on your own, let me know and I'll make more of an effort to make this 
transportable/usable by others. ROS development happens almost entirely on the rover.
